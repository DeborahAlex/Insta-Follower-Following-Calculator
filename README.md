# Insta-Follower-Following-Calculator
Have you ever wondered who those people are who you follow on Instagram but they do not follow you back? (and no I am not talking about the big accounts). Well this program will help you identify these accounts since Instagram natively does not! 

You just have to request Instagram to give you your account details in .json format. (It is an option available in Instagram to find it : your account -> settings -> Privacy and Security -> Data Download -> Request Download {remember to request for json format})

Enter the location of follower.json and following.json present in the download given by instagram in the program and run it to get the results! 

command: python3 main.py
